# libavif [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/joedrago/avif?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/joedrago/avif) [![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joedrago/avif.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/joedrago/avif)

This library aims to be a friendly, portable C implementation of the AV1 Image File Format, as described here:

https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-avif/

It is a work-in-progress, but can already encode and decode all AOM supported YUV formats and bit depths (with alpha).

For now, it is recommended that you checkout/use [tagged releases](https://github.com/joedrago/avif/tags) instead of just using the master branch. I will regularly create new versions as bugfixes and features are added.

# Build Notes

Building libavif requires [NASM](https://nasm.us/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

Make sure nasm is available and in your PATH on your machine, then use CMake to do a basic build (Debug or Release).

# Prebuilt Library (Windows)

If you're building on Windows with VS2017 and want to try out libavif without going through the build process, static library builds for both Debug and Release are available on [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/joedrago/avif).
